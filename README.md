### Overall Results

This project primarily focuses on multilingual text sentiment analysis and exploratory data analysis of social media platforms, particularly Twitter. The goal is to identify and understand patterns in data to detect and mitigate hate speech, promoting a safer online environment.

#### Key Findings:
1. **Data Annotation and Integrity:** The project utilized a comprehensive data annotation process, classifying tweets into categories such as aggression intensity, discursive roles, gender, religious, caste/class, and ethnic/racial biases. A disagreement task was implemented to ensure data accuracy by resolving inconsistencies among annotators.

2. **Model Training and Evaluation:** Several models, including BERT-base and RoBERTa-base, were trained and tested on the annotated data. The models were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and precision. The performance of these models provided insights into their effectiveness in detecting sentiment and biases in social media text.

3. **Large Language Model (LLM) Implementation:** The project also explored the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) like LLaMA and Vicuna for zero-shot inference. The results were compared with the pretrained models, offering a broader perspective on model performance.

4. **Research and Practical Implementation:** The project integrated insights from research papers on sentiment analysis and topic modeling. This guided the practical implementation of various models, including pretrained models like BERT for topic modeling, traditional models like LDA, and statistical models like NMF. The analysis extracted the top 10 topics discussed in the dataset, using word cloud visualization for clarity.

5. **Technical Knowledge and Problem-Solving:** The project's tasks demonstrated a strong understanding of technical concepts and problem-solving approaches, particularly in handling complex data, model training, and evaluation.

The overall results showcase a robust approach to multilingual sentiment analysis, with a focus on ensuring data integrity and leveraging advanced models for accurate and insightful analysis. The projectâ€™s findings contribute to the ongoing efforts to foster a safer and more inclusive digital environment.
